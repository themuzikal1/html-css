            I am a 34-year-old aspiring sofware developer.  I am originally from New York; however, I grew up in Mississppi. Dallas, Texas has been my home since 2011.  I have a Bachelor's in Public Affairs from The University of Texas at Dallas, and a Master's of City and Regional Planning from The University of Texas at Arlington.  I am a self-taught musician and my favorite genre is jazz. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, traveling, and cooking.

            Previously, I was an Urban Planner for 6 years; however, I have always had an interest in learning how to code.  I started watching tutorials online and I became hooked.  I am excited about this opportunity and I look forward to learning and growing as a developer.
